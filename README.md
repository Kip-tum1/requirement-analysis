# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Detailed explanation of Requirement Analysis, including its importance in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Steps of requirements analysis process:

Step 1: Stakeholder Identification
called requirements gathering

The first step in the requirements analysis process of a software development project is stakeholder identification.

Simply put, this is the process of finding out who has a stake in the success of the software being developed. Stakeholders are not just the customers who commission the software, but a broader group. They include the end users who will interact with the software on a daily basis and who may have valuable insight into what features are essential.

It’s important to identify all of these stakeholders early on, because each can provide unique perspectives and requirements.

Step 2: Elicitation of Requirements

The second step in the requirements analysis process is requirements elicitation.

This is where the team actively gathers detailed information about what the software needs to do from the identified stakeholders. It’s like gathering pieces of a puzzle from different sources to see the whole picture.

The team uses a variety of methods to do this. Interviews are common, where team members have one-on-one conversations with stakeholders to understand their needs. Questionnaires can be sent out to quickly gather information from a larger group. Another method is user observation, where the team observes how potential users interact with existing systems to identify unspoken needs or problems.

This step is critical because it’s about gathering as much relevant information as possible to ensure that the software is designed to meet the real needs of its users.

Step 3: Documentation of Requirements
identify key stakeholders

The third step in the requirements analysis process is requirements documentation.

After gathering all the necessary information from stakeholders, it’s time to put it all down on paper, or more likely, in a digital document.

The goal of this step is to create a clear, detailed record of what the software needs to do and the constraints within which it must operate. The team typically creates a document called a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which serves as a guide for everyone involved in the project. This document includes everything from the specific features the software must have, to the performance levels required, to the standards it must meet.

It’s important to get this step right because the SRS acts as a reference point throughout the software development life cycle. It helps ensure that developers understand exactly what they need to build, and it provides a way to measure progress and test the final product against the original requirements. Simply put, this document is the blueprint for the software project, outlining what needs to be built and how it should work, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

Step 4: Analysis and Negotiation

The fourth step in the requirements analysis process is analysis and negotiation.

This stage involves taking a closer look at the documented requirements to make sure they are realistic and workable.

The team examines each requirement to understand its implications:

How difficult will it be to implement?
Does it conflict with any other requirements?
Is it actually necessary for the software’s success?
This is a bit like solving a puzzle, making sure all the pieces fit together in the right way.

Negotiation comes into play when there are conflicting requirements or limitations in resources like time or budget.

Sometimes, what the stakeholders want might not be feasible, or different stakeholders might have different priorities. In such cases, the team needs to discuss these issues with the stakeholders to reach a common ground. This could mean adjusting some requirements, removing others, or finding a middle path that satisfies the most critical needs without overstretching resources.

The goal here is to finalize a set of requirements that is achievable and aligns with the overall objectives of the project. It’s a balancing act, ensuring that the software will fulfill its intended purpose while staying within practical limits.

Step 5: Validation and Verification

The final step in the requirements analysis process, which combines both validation and verification, is critical to ensuring that the project is on the right track.

Validation is about confirming that the requirements actually meet the needs of the stakeholders and the goals of the project.

It’s like asking, “Are we building the right thing?” Here, the team reviews the requirements with the stakeholders to make sure they are in line with their expectations and the goals of the project.

In addition to the validation aspect of the final step in the requirements analysis process, there’s an important component known as the proof of concept (PoC). A proof of concept is a small project or experiment conducted to test whether a particular idea or aspect of the software is technically feasible.

It allows the development team to explore whether the ambitious goals can actually be achieved with current technology and within the constraints of the project, such as time and budget.

Verification, on the other hand, is about making sure that the requirements are documented correctly and consistently. It’s like proofreading and quality checking the requirements document. The team reviews the document to ensure that all requirements are clear, unambiguous, and consistent.

Together, validation and verification serve as a double check to ensure that the software development process is built on a solid foundation of well-defined, agreed-upon, and accurately recorded requirements.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
